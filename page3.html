    <h2>3. Data structures</h2>
    <h4>A data structure provides an effective way to store and retrieve data. There are various data structures that computer programmers can use to complete tasks and run applications.<br> These are some commonly used data structures:
        Arrays: Arrays organize data by storing similar elements together and using contiguous memory allocation. You can use arrays to store an ordered list of items.<br>
        Stacks: Stacks are linear structures that follow a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order for executing operations. You can use stacks to store data that get processed in a specific order.<br>
        Queues: The queue is a linear structure that follows a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order for executing operations. You can use queues to store data that don't require immediate processing.
        Linked lists: Linked lists are linear data structures that use pointers to link elements instead of contiguous memory locations. You can use them to implement stacks, queues, and graphs.
        Binary trees: Binary trees are non-linear structures containing nodes that have two possible values or directions. You can use binary trees to represent hierarchy and determine structural relationships in data.<br>
        Graphs: Graphs contain nodes and edges connected to one another. You can use these data structures to study maps, resource allocation in operating systems, and social media networks.
        Hash-tables: Hash-tables, also known as maps, store key-value pairs. You can retrieve the value in the hash table by specifying its key where a key can store multiple values.</h4>
