    <h2>2. Control structures</h1>
    <h4>A control structure specifies the flow of control in a program. Analyzing certain parameters and conditions determines the flow direction of a program. Control structures make it easier to understand a flow of logic when developing algorithms or writing programs. There are three basic types of control structures:
        Sequential logic: The flow of a program executes in a specific order without skipping, jumping, or switching to another block of code.
        Selection logic: A condition determines whether a block of code gets executed or skipped. Common examples include if and else-if.
        Iteration logic: A block of code repeats a fixed number of times to achieve the desired result. Common examples include for and while loop.</h3>
