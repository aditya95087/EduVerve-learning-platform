  <h2>1. Variable declaration<h3><hr>
    <h4>Variables are containers for storing values. You can declare variables using variable names.<br> Declaring a variable instructs the operating system to reserve a piece of memory with that variable name.<br> You can define a variable with letters, digits, and underscores. Variables store standard data types, such as:
    Number: Numbers store numerical values. The various numerical types include int, long, float, and complex used to store signed integers, long integers, floating-point real values, and complex numbers, respectively.
    String: Strings store a set of characters enclosed either by single or double quotes.
    List: Lists can store multiple items, such as integers, floats, strings, or other lists, in a single variable. The items stored in a list are changeable, ordered, and accessible via indexes.
    Tuple: Tuples can store multiple items, such as integers, floats, strings, or other lists, in a single variable. The items stored in a tuple are unchangeable, ordered, and accessible via indexes.
    Dictionary: Dictionaries store key-value pairs. The items stored in a tuple are unordered, unchangeable, and accessible using a key.</h5>
