    <h2>4. Object-oriented programming</h2>
    <h4>Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of objects and classes where an object may contain data in the form of attributes and methods. Classes are user-defined blueprints or prototypes from which you can create objects. For example, consider a class that represents a car.<br> The car class contains attributes such as colour, date of manufacture, weight, and mileage. You can then use this class as a blueprint to create objects where each object represents a different car with a unique set of attributes. Some important concepts in object-oriented programming include:
        Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the binding of data elements, such as variables and properties and member methods, into one unit.
        Abstraction: Abstraction enables you to hide specific details about a class and provide only essential information to the outside world. You can use the 'abstract' keyword to declare an abstract class.
        Inheritance: Inheritance enables you to create a new class from an existing class. For example, you can create many child classes which inherit all the properties of their parent classes and have their own set of additional attributes and methods.
        Polymorphism: Using polymorphism, you can access objects of different types using the same interface where each object provides its own implementation.</h4>
