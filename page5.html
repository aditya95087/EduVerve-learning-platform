    <h2>5. Debugging</h2>
    <h4>Debugging is the process of removing errors from computer programs. The process allows software development and engineering teams to ensure that the software works as intended.<br> You can encounter various coding errors throughout the development phase. Below is a list of possible errors:
        Syntax error
        Syntax errors arise when characters or tokens in the code don't follow the syntax of the programming language. These errors can be due to indentation errors, missing brackets, extra commas, or misspelled commands. An IDE detects such errors and displays the line number, error type, and description along with the error. After reviewing the error description, you can modify the code to follow the correct syntax.
        Runtime errors
        A runtime error occurs when there is a flaw in the algorithm or logic of the code. This results in the program producing unexpected results. You encounter logical errors only during runtime since there are no errors in the code's syntax, which results in a successful compilation. For instance, wrongly initializing a variable can cause a logical error in the code.
        Latent errors
        Latent errors, also known as hidden errors, arise when you use a specific set of data as input to the program. A program can fail or produce incorrect results if you fail to account for an outlier or edge case. You may have created a program that prompts users to enter their dates of birth but does not account for characters or negative numbers they may enter incorrectly. This could cause the program to crash or halt.</h4>
